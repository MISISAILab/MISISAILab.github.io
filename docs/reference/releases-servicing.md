# ONNX Runtime releases

The current ONNX Runtime release is [1.12](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases/tag/v1.12.0).

The next release is ONNX Runtime release [1.13](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/projects/11).

Official releases of ONNX Runtime are managed by the core ONNX Runtime team. A new release is published approximately every quarter.

Releases are versioned according to [Versioning](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/docs/Versioning.md) and release branches are prefixed with "rel-". Patch releases may be published periodically between full releases and have their own release branch.

ONNX Runtime releases commit to backwards compatibility. To report a regression, please [file a Github issue](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/new/choose).
