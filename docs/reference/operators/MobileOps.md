# ORT Mobile Pre-Built Package Operator and Type Support

These are the operators and types included in the ORT Mobile pre-built packages for each release.

The full list of input models used to determine this list is available [here](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/tools/ci_build/github/android/mobile_package.required_operators.readme.txt).
