## Swift Usage

The Objective-C API can be called from Swift code.
To enable this, use a bridging header (more info [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/importing-objective-c-into-swift)) that imports the ORT Objective-C API header.

```objectivec
// In the bridging header, import the ORT Objective-C API header.
#import <onnxruntime.h>
```
